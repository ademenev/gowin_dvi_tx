## Improved DVI encoder for Gowin FPGAs

*Turned out that the issue has been fixed in recent versions of software. The IP generated by latest software does not have the issue*

Output produced by generated "DVI TX" IP is not recognized by cheap HDMI-USB
dongles.

Signal generated by included "dvi_tx" module is reliably recognized.

This is a drop-in replacement for the generated IP with identical interface.
